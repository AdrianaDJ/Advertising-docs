# OAuth C# Example
The following topics break out a simple desktop implementation used to get an access and refresh token. The example does not support the recommended state query parameter.

If you use the Bing Ads C# SDK, you should use it to get your OAuth access and refresh tokens. For information, see [Get Started](../transaction-message/get-started.md).
