The final URL must be the URL of the page that the user ends up on after clicking your ad (and after all redirects have taken place).

If not specified, the entity inherits the final URL from its parent entity. For example, the keyword entity inherits the ad's final URL. You specify the keyword's final URL if you want to override the ad's final URL.
